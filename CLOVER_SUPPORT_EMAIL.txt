Subject: API Token 401 Unauthorized - Merchant 179188390993

Hello Clover Support,

I'm experiencing persistent 401 Unauthorized errors when trying to use the Clover REST API, despite having a correctly configured API token.

Merchant Information:
- Merchant ID: 179188390993
- Merchant Name: NUTRICENTRO

Token Details:
- Token Name: "Lightspeed Bridge"
- Token Value: 4cd8616c-169a-8e7d-7174-b4018efc3bbc
- Integration Type: REST API (confirmed in dashboard)
- Token Status: Active/Enabled (toggle is on)
- Permissions: All Read permissions enabled (Customers, Employees, Inventory, Merchant, Orders, Payments)

What I've Verified:
1. ✅ Token type is "REST API" (not Ecommerce API)
2. ✅ Token is active/enabled in dashboard
3. ✅ Orders Read permission is enabled
4. ✅ Permissions were saved after configuration
5. ✅ Cleared cache and regenerated token
6. ✅ Tested multiple authentication methods (Bearer token, query parameter)
7. ✅ Tested multiple API endpoints (v3/merchants, v3/orders)

Error Details:
- All API calls return: {"message": "401 Unauthorized"}
- Tested endpoints:
  * GET https://api.clover.com/v3/merchants/179188390993
  * GET https://api.clover.com/v3/merchants/179188390993/orders
- Authentication methods tried:
  * Authorization: Bearer {token}
  * ?access_token={token} query parameter
  * Both methods together

Request:
Could you please verify:
1. Is REST API access enabled for merchant account 179188390993?
2. Are there any account-level restrictions preventing API access?
3. Are there any IP whitelisting requirements for this token?
4. Is the token correctly configured on your end?
5. What is the correct authentication method for REST API private tokens?

I've followed all the documentation steps, and the dashboard shows everything is configured correctly, yet I'm unable to make any API calls. This suggests there may be an account-level configuration issue.

Thank you for your assistance!

Best regards
